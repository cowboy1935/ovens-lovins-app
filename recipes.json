            "In a clean bowl, add the egg white and sugar and mix with a hand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium-low until combined, less than 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium-high and whisk until soft peaks form, about 2-3 minutes. Add the cornstarch mix and food coloring, starting with one drop of the food coloring, incorporating it with the mixer then repeating until the color is to your liking. Continue to whisk until stiff, glossy, peaks begin to form, about 3-5 more minutes.",
            "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Use a spatula to scrape the meringue out of the bowl directly onto the parchment paper and shape it into about a 4-inch circle. The meringue should be at least 1-inch high. Use the spatula or the back of a spoon to create a shallow bowl-like shape in the center, pushing the edges up a bit (this will create a space for the raspberry curd to sit in later).",
            "Transfer the baking sheet to the oven, and immediately reduce the heat to 220˚F (105˚C). Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, then turn off the oven and let it sit in the oven for a few hours until fully cooled. Do not open the oven door throughout any of the cooking and cooling processes. Remove from the oven at least 3 hours after turning it off.",
            "Make the Raspberry Curd: Set a fine-mesh strainer over a medium heatproof bowl. If planning to use the curd soon after making, prepare an ice bath. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until fully melted. If the butter starts to bubble, lower the heat. Add raspberries, sugar, egg yolks, lemon juice and salt and whisk to combine. Cook for 7-9 minutes, until the mixture reaches at least 160˚F (70˚C) and has started to thicken like pudding.",
            "Strain through the mesh strainer, discard any solids and stir lemon zest  into the strained curd. Taste for seasoning and, if using soon, place in the ice bath and stir often to cool it down quickly. If using later, cover the surface of the curd with plastic wrap (so a film doesn’t form) then place in the refrigerator to cool. Once cooled, store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use.",
            "Make the chocolate-covered strawberries: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Make a double boiler by filling a medium saucepan with about 2” of water and bring the water to a simmer. Place chocolate and coconut oil in a medium metal, glass or other heat proof bowl and place the bowl over simmering water, ensuring the bottom of the bowl does not come into contact with the water.",

            "Remove the bowl from the heat and place on a kitchen towel. Dry the outside of the bowl completely. Holding one strawberry by its stem, gently dip it in melted chocolate about ¾ of the way up the berry, but do not completely submerge. Gently shake off the excess chocolate back into the bowl, and place dipped strawberry on the parchment lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining strawberries.",
            "Let cool at room temperature for 30-45 minutes, or place the baking sheet in the refrigerator and let chill until solid, about 15-25 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator 20-30 minutes before serving.",
            "To serve, place the pavlova on a serving plate. Spoon the raspberry curd into the middle of the pavlova, adding as much or as little as you like. Tuck the chocolate strawberries into the curd and around the plate, and add fresh raspberries if you like. Serve with two spoons.",
            "Note: Make sure the mixing bowl is completely clean and dry before making the pavlova, and that no traces of egg yolk are left behind when separating the white from the yolk. Any fat leftover in the bowl or form the yolk will prevent the meringue from achieving perfection. Tips: -Save the egg yolk from the pavlova to use in the raspberry curd. If doubling or increasing the pavlova recipe, use a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Pavlova can be made up to 24 hours in advance, simply store in an airtight container in a dark, cool place but not in the refrigerator. Raspberry curd can be made up to 3 days in advance: store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use. -Chocolate dipped strawberries will last in the refrigerator up to 24 hours, but are best served within a few hours."

            "Make the dumpling dough: Place flour and salt in a medium bowl and stir with chopsticks. Slowly add in almost all the water as you stir with chopsticks, but don’t use the entire cup at first. As you mix, a shaggy dough mixture will start to form. If the dough isn’t coming together, add the remainder of the water and continue to mix. Use your hands to knead the dough either in the bowl or on a clean work surface for 7-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit for 20-25 minutes. Knead the dough for another 5 minutes then cover with a slightly damp kitchen towel. Let rest for another hour.",
            "While the dough rests, make the filling: In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients and mix with chopsticks or your hands. Stir everything together until just combined, and place in the refrigerator until ready to use.",
            "Make the dipping sauce: Gently toast the spices in a small, dry skillet over medium-high heat until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Transfer spices to a small saucepan with the vinegar, soy sauce and sugar. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and allow to cool.",
            "Once the dough has rested and is soft to the touch, divide into 4 pieces and roll those pieces out into a long log about 1” thick. Cut each log into ½-inch pieces, each piece should weigh between 11-13 grams and as uniform in size as possible. Roll each piece into a ball and store, sprinkled with flour so they don’t stick, underneath a damp kitchen towel. Working one at a time, flatten the ball into a small round disk with the palm of your hand. Use a small rolling pin or 1-inch thick wooden dowel with one hand and hold the disc in the other hand. Working in small movements, start to flatten the dough with the pin, rolling up from the bottom, and turning about ⅛ rotation each time you roll, so the disc begins to flatten into a wrapper. Continue this process, adding more flour as needed so nothing sticks, until the dough has turned into about a 3 ½-inch circle.",
            "The dough should be very thin but not so thin that the filling will rip through, with the edges being thinner than the middle of the circle. Place the wrapper on a floured surface and cover with a damp towel. Repeat this process until all the dough is used.",
            "Using a tablespoon or chopsticks, scoop the filling into one dumpling and fold the wrapper in half over the filling to make a half circle. Use floured fingers to pinch the middle of the half circle together, then start by crimping the front half of the wrapper towards the middle, repeating 2-3 more times until you get to the end of the half circle. Repeat this with the remaining unsealed half, until the entire dumpling is tightly sealed in a neat, crimped package. Place on a lightly floured plate or tray and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Repeat until all the filling is used.",
            "To cook: Set a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan and fill the pan with dumplings, giving them about ½-inch of space in between. Pour about ⅓ cup of water into the pan and cover with a lid. Let steam until all the water has evaporated, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the lid and cook until the bottoms are golden brown and crispy, about 1-2 more minutes. Remove the dumplings from the pan and set on their sides (as you don’t want to let the crispy bottoms get soggy). Serve immediately, or continue cooking another batch of dumplings. Uncooked dumplings can be frozen raw for up to 2 months. Cook from frozen in the same manner, but add ½ cup water and steam for 8-10 minutes.",
            "To serve, divide dumplings among plates and pour the dipping sauce into individual bowls. Top dumplings with scallions and cilantro.",
            "Tip: -Alternatively, you can make the dough in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Use the same process but only knead for 5-7 minutes the first time (rather than 7-10). Use a pasta roller rather than rolling out the individual pieces by dividing the rested dough in half, coating generously with flour and rolling each dough half gradually down to the 6 thinness setting on the pasta roller, then cutting out the individual wrappers with a 3 ½-inch ring cutter."

            "Prepare the Turkey: Lay out the breast and, if needed, use a sharp knife to butterfly the breast to create an even thickness throughout. Pound slightly if needed Season the turkey breast generously with salt on all sides and set on a sheet tray lined with a wire rack. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight. Remove from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature at least 30 minutes before cooking.",
            "Cook the Turkey: Preheat the oven to 250˚F (120˚C).",
            "Roll the turkey breast up into a cylindrical shape and use kitchen twine to truss and hold this shape. Tear off a large square of heavy duty aluminum foil and place the trussed turkey breast at the bottom center of the square, closest to you.",
            "Drizzle a tablespoon or two of oil over the turkey and use your hands to coat all over. Clean your hands, then lift the bottom of the square of foil up and over the turkey, carefully but tightly rolling it into a perfect cylinder. Tighten the two ends by twisting like a candy wrapper and tuck them towards the same side as the seam of foil.",
            "Place this, seam side up, on a clean sheet tray lined with a wire rack and place in the oven. Cook for about 2 hours, until a thermometer reads at least 160˚F (71˚C)  when inserted into the very center of the turkey. Let cool for 30 minutes then remove foil to cool further.",
            "Make the Crepes: Place all ingredients in a blender and blend on high for 15 - 30 seconds, until the batter is smooth and no pockets of flour remain.",
            "Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Grease the skillet by pouring a small amount of oil into the pan and wiping it all over the surface with a paper towel. Pour a scant ⅓ cup of the batter into the skillet, tilting to coat the surface of the pan evenly. Cook for 1–2 minutes, until the batter looks dry on top. Flip and cook for about another minute, making sure the crepe does not get any color. The crepe should still be pale, soft, and pliable rather than golden and crisp. Transfer the crepe on a baking sheet or plate and while you repeat with the remaining batter, lightly greasing the pan with more shallot oil between crepes.",
            "Make the Stuffing: Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and cook until soft and slightly caramelized, about 5-7 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and let cool for a few minutes. Once cooled, add the remaining ingredients to the large bowl and mix with your hands to combine. Place in the refrigerator until ready to use.",
            "Assemble: Stack the 4 crepes on top of one another and trim the edges to make a large square.",
            "Lay two long pieces of plastic wrap on a work station, overlapping by about 4 inches. Lay the 4 crepes down to make one large square, overlapping each by at least ½-inch. Scoop 2 cups of the stuffing onto the bottom part of the crepe square, and press into another square that starts at the very bottom of the crepe square and reaches about ¾ of the way up the crepe square, leaving a few inches of crepe empty on the top. Press into a solid layer as thin as possible, about ¼-inch thick. Be sure to wash your hands after handling the raw stuffing before moving on to the next step.",
            "Carefully cut and remove the twine from the turkey, ensuring that it stays in the cylindrical shape. Place it at the very bottom of the crepe and stuffing square and, letting the plastic wrap do the work for you, tightly and carefully roll upwards away from you until the bottom edge of the crepe reaches the top and overlaps slightly. Use a paring knife to trim off any excess crepe from the top and sides, leaving at least a 1-inch border all around. Tuck in these sides and make sure no plastic wrap is still stuck in between the crepe layers. Roll all the way over the top with the plastic wrap and use the same technique you used to wrap the turkey breast cylinder in foil. Fold the crepe edges on the sides into themselves, creating a tight bundle where no stuffing nor turkey is exposed. Tighten the two ends by twisting like a candy wrapper and tuck them towards the same side as the seam of plastic wrap.",
            "Place in the freezer for 30 minutes. While this freezes, remove the puff pastry from the freezer and let thaw.",
            "Once pastry is thawed, you will repeat a similar process to envelope the crepe-covered turkey breast in the puff pastry. Lay two long pieces of plastic wrap on a work station, overlapping by about 4 inches. Using a rolling pin, roll each square of puff pastry to a width that is at least 2 inches wider than the turkey cylinder. The pastry should be about ⅛-inch thin. Brush a thin layer of egg wash on the bottom edge of one pastry square and lay the second pastry square directly below it, overlapping by ½-inch. Use the rolling pin to seal the two pastry squares together. Brush the entire pastry with egg wash.",
            "Remove the crepe cylinder from the freezer and carefully unwrap and discard the plastic wrap. Set the cylinder at the bottom of the pastry rectangle and use the same process to encase the cylinder in the puff pastry. Roll upwards away from you until the bottom edge of the puff pastry reaches the top. Trim away excess pastry, leaving 1-inch extra to overlap. Seal the bottom edge of pastry to the top edge by brushing lightly with the egg wash and pressing together. Trim any excess dough from the sides, leaving just enough to encase the cylinder, about ½-inch. Create a tight bundle again by twisting the ends and rolling back and forth on the work surface. Tuck the ends underneath the seam side and place in the freezer for 15 minutes.",
            "Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). Place a sheet tray in the oven to preheat as well--this will prevent a soggy bottom.",
            "Remove the wellington from the freezer, then remove the plastic wrap and place seam-side down on a piece of parchment paper. Score an appealing pattern on top using the back of a paring knife, then brush the entire surface with egg wash. Sprinkle with flaky salt. Carefully remove the hot sheet tray from the oven, lift the parchment paper and wellington onto the hot tray and return to the oven.",
            "Cook for 40-45 minutes, until the puff pastry is a deep golden brown. Rotate the pan 180˚ halfway through baking and, if desired, brush a second time with the egg wash. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. Serve with cranberry sauce alongside."

Add the dried mushrooms, pour in 10 cups of water and bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer for at least 30, longer if you have the time. Remove from heat and strain into a medium stock pot, pressing down on the vegetables to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the vegetables and place the strained stock over very low heat to keep warm while you make the risotto.",

Add shallot, leeks, and a pinch of salt and saute for 3-5 minutes, until they start to soften. Add mushrooms and thyme and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender and most of the liquid has evaporated. Add barley and a small pinch of salt and let toast for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Add white wine to deglaze and scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, and cook for a few minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated. Reduce the heat to medium-low and pour in a ladle of mushroom stock. Stir frequently until the most of the liquid has been absorbed by the barley. Continue this process of adding a ladle of stock and stirring until it has absorbed for about 30-40 minutes, when the barley is tender but still has a bit of a bite to it. Remove from heat and stir in truffle cheese and lemon zest. Taste for seasoning and adjust, if needed.",

Compote can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.",

            "Make the dough: In the bowl of a standing mixer combine yeast, warm water, and 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Stir to combine and let sit until foamy and tripled in volume, about 10 minutes. Add remaining sugar, milk, light brown sugar, vanilla, egg, and egg yolks and whisk to combine. Add flour and salt and mix on medium-low speed with a dough hook and knead dough for 5-8 minutes, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms into a ball on the hook. Reduce the speed to low and add the butter a couple of tablespoons at a time, waiting until most of the butter is absorbed before adding more. Continue to knead about 2-5 minutes, until the dough passes the windowpane test (see note below).",
            "Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 ½ –2 hours. Alternatively, place the covered bowl in the refrigerator overnight for a slow proof.",
            "While the dough rises, make the fillings: Combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla and salt in a medium bowl with a hand mixer until well-combined and fluffy. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the cinnamon and sugar; set aside. In another small bowl, use a fork to whisk together the egg and water for the egg wash. Set aside.",
            "Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Use aluminum foil to create 4 balls about 1-inch large and coat with baking spray; set aside. Once the dough has risen, lightly punch down dough and turn it out onto a very lightly floured work surface. Use a knife to divide the dough in half. Using a rolling pin, roll the first half of dough into a 20x6-inch rectangle. Use just enough flour to make rolling out possible, you don’t want to over-flour.",
            "Use a pastry brush to lightly coat the surface of the dough with melted butter, leaving about 1-inch unbrushed along the top edge. Lightly sprinkle the entire surface with half of the cinnamon sugar mixture, trying to avoid the top inch.",
            "Cut about 1-inch off of the tip of the piping bag and pipe a line of cream cheese filling along the long bottom edge of the dough.",
            "Use your fingertips to lift the bottom of the dough up and over the cream cheese, and gently continue to roll the dough all the way up until it meets the other end. Use your fingers to pinch the seam together, then trim the uneven ends off and discard (no more than 1-inch per side). Use a knife to cut the roll into two even halves. Gently push the two ends of one half together to form a circle and pinch the dough together on all sides, being careful not to let any of the cream cheese squeeze through.",
            "Repeat with the second half and set both circles on one prepared baking sheet. Repeat this entire process with the other half of dough. Place one foil ball in the center of each dough circle to help keep the shape while baking. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175˚C).",
            "Uncover cakes and brush all over with egg wash. Place in the oven and bake until golden brown, about 20-25 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the dough reaches 190˚F (87˚C) and the cakes are golden brown. Let cool for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool.",
            "While the cakes bake, make the glaze: in a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and milk until smooth. It should be the consistency of royal icing, thick but still flowing. Set the rack over a baking sheet. Once the cakes are mostly cooled, pour icing evenly over the cakes so that it drips slightly over the sides. Decorate immediately with sprinkles in an alternating pattern before the icing dries, or frost then sprinkle individually.",
            "While the cakes cool, make the maple glaze: In a small saucepan over medium heat, add the butter, brown sugar and maple syrup. Once the butter has melted and the sugars have started to dissolve, add the pecans and salt. Let the sauce bubble and thicken for 2 minutes, then remove from heat and carefully add the heavy cream. Return to heat and let boil for another 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for a moment.",
            "To serve, stack the mini king cakes on top of each other and carefully spoon the maple pecan glaze all over the stack.",
            "Note: Using wet fingers, gently use your hands to stretch a small portion of the dough apart. If the dough tears quickly, the gluten is not developed enough yet and you need to knead for longer. If the dough stretches thinly without breaking and you can see light through it, the dough is ready.",
            "Tips: -Measure flour properly by spooning flour into a measuring cup then leveling off the excess with a flat-edged knife, rather than scooping up the flour directly from the container. -Use the inside of the leftover butter wrapper to grease the bowl the dough will rise in."

Slice each orange quarter as thinly as possible, discarding the top and bottom ends and any seeds. Place slices and any leftover juice in a medium bowl and add lemon zest and juice. Add sugar to the bowl and stir with a spatula to coat all the orange slices in sugar. Place a small plate or other flat object on top of the fruit to submerge the oranges in liquid. Cover with plastic wrap and let macerate overnight at room temperature (or in the refrigerator if your kitchen is warm).",
            "After macerating, transfer the mixture to a large, heavy-bottomed pot and place over medium-high heat. Add cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, vanilla bean and 4 cups of water and bring to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a simmer. Simmer for about 90-120 minutes, until the liquid has reduced to a jammy consistency and the thermometer reaches 220˚F (104˚C). Immediately remove from the heat. Carefully remove the whole spices and vanilla bean, then use an immersion blender to blend the jam to a creamier consistency.",
            "Let the jam cool a bit before transferring to airtight containers, and let the containers cool completely before sealing, labeling and storing in the refrigerator. Jam will keep for 3 months, but always look for signs of mold before consuming after it’s initial opening.",
            "Make the Hot Cross Buns: In a small saucepan, combine the water roux ingredients. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens to a paste, about 1-2 minutes. Immediately remove from heat and transfer to a small bowl to chill.",
            "Rehydrate the dried fruit by adding dried raisins, currants, rum and water to a small saucepan. Bring to a boil then reduce heat, letting simmer for about 2 minutes before removing from heat and letting soak for 5-10 minutes. Once plump and hydrated, strain and discard the liquid. Pat the fruit dry and set aside.",
            "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the cooled water roux with all of the dough ingredients except the raisins, currants and citrus peel. Mix on low speed for 3-5 minutes, scraping down the sides occasionally, until the dough is soft and elastic. It will still be very sticky and will still fall to the bottom of the bowl (rather than sitting in a ball on the dough hook). Add in the raisins, currants and candied citrus peel, mixing again on low speed until the fruit is incorporated into the dough. You may need to use a spatula to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to incorporate.",
            "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour. The dough might not double in size, but it should have risen significantly. Generously grease two 9\" x 13\" baking dishes.",
            "While the dough rises, make the rum glaze: Place water, rum and orange peels in a small skillet and place over medium heat. Bring to a simmer then carefully tilt the skillet towards the flame to ignite the rum. Let the alcohol burn for a few seconds before blowing to extinguish. Add the sugar and reduce heat to let simmer for 1-2 minutes, until the glaze is reduced slightly and fragrant. Remove from heat and let the orange peels infuse until ready to use.",
            "Once risen, turn out the dough onto a greased work surface, and grease your hands as well. Use a knife or bench scraper to divide the dough into quarters, then divide those quarters in half. Each eighth of dough should weigh about 175g. Shape the 8 portions into balls (they don’t need to be perfect). From there, divide each of the balls into quarters, leaving you with 32 pieces of dough. Grease your hands well throughout this process to make the sticky dough easier to work with.",
            "Use your hands to roll each portion into a neat ball, tucking and pinching the underneath side closed. If any fruits fall out, simply stick them in the bottom of the ball and reseal. Arrange the dough balls evenly between the two baking dishes (you will have 2 extra balls, tuck them in at the top of one of the baking dishes).",
            "Let the dough rise again for about 1 hour. While the dough rises, make the cross paste: in a small bowl, combine the flour, water and butter with a spatula and mix until smooth. The paste should be thick enough to pipe but not runny. Add another splash of water if the paste is too stiff. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag.",
            "Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C).",
            "Once the buns have risen, brush egg wash all over the tops and sides of the buns. Snip the tip off the piping bag and pipe the crosses on top. Bake the buns for 22-27 minutes, until they're golden brown on top and the internal temperature reaches 190˚F (87˚C). Remove from the oven and immediately brush all over with the rum glaze.
